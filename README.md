# Boids
This is a flocking algorithm I coded for Autodesk Maya more than a year ago now.  It can be run by pasting the contents of main.py into the Python Script window for 
Autodesk Maya 2018 or later.  Autodesk Maya uses a modified version of the Python standard library version 2.x so some of the things in the code are rather 
old fashioned.  In addition, you cannot import libraries that could have made the boids calculations code run a lot faster such as NumPy.
